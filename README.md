# How to (how do I) create a React App with create-react-app & publish it with GitHub Pages | Step By Step Tutorial

## Motivation
In this project my motivation was to have all the necessary steps of creating React App and publishing it on GitHub Pages in one place.
So as you see I've made it for myself.

As a self-taught developer I know how hard it can be to find the pieces of information you need in different available sources and put them together and... let it work...

That's why I've decided to publish the steps of the process and not have it only for my own use.
So... feel free to use this knowledge & happy coding!

## What you need to know/ have to complete these steps
- Basic knowledge of React (+ export/ import)
- GitHub account
